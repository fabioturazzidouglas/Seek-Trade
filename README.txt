Functions/Description:	
		Seek & Trade is a Marketplace app which offers a safe platform for users to create and search for posts, 
		allowing sellers and buyers to contact each other by e-mail for setting up transactions.
		After a simple registration or authentication process, we allow users to view and edit their profiles, 
		view, edit and delete their posts, create new posts, upload photos, and search for posts.
		This app uses SQL Lite Database, modularized with SQLLiteOpenHelper, and is integrated with 
		Firebase Authentication, Glide, and Firebase Storage.

Installation Instructions:	
		All extensions are already set up on Android's build.gradle file. To install this app, please import it
		to Android Studio and Build Project.
		For testing and demonstration purposes, a method is called in the login activity to populate the database
		with some sample Users and Posts. This method call can be removed for a future Release version.
